# Digital Circlism
It is a modern artistic expression in which paintings are made with digital tools usually featuring celebrities made of thousands of flat circles on a black background.
# Project Overview
Using traditional method for circlism is time consuming but using algorithms we can save that time.
This project consists of a algorithmic artwork. It is designed to apply digital circlism to images within 10 minutes or less depending upon image resolution.

These are some outputs of our project.

## Steps
1. Image Segementation using Mean Shift Filtering.
2. Removing background for better results.
3. Canny Edge detection for boundaries.
4. Euclidean distance transformation for packing density.
5. Packing circles using the packing density.
